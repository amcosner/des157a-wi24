                <h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
                <p>This is a response to this <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f?gi=e43efd85f22d">article.</a>
                </p>
                <p>I found this article very helpful and easy to follow, especially since I deal with a lot of dental forms for my job, so I definitely feel familiar with overwhelming form design. </p>
                <p>With this, I’ll keep in mind that forms should have minimal inputs and the goal is to have the least amount of objects on the screen possible. This is important for me since I tend to ask a lot of very detailed questions and will certainly need to keep this in check for my MadLib project.</p>
                <h3>Madlib Revisions</h3>
                <p>I’ve received lots of inspiration from this article for my project, specifically with the ‘one column layout’ rule (since my comp currently has 2 columns), and the efficiency of having a timeline that shows user’s progress in filling out the form. Since my madlib project might need multiple screens of input, I plan to use this technique. </p>
                <h3 id="labels">Labels</h3>
                <p>It’s good practice to keep labels close to the input fields. My Madlib comp currently has tags inside of the input fields, which after reading this article, I plan to change since there are some usability concerns with it (ex: not being able to see the label once you start typing).</p>
                <p>On this note, I would also like to allow users to use the tab button to improve usability. My current submit button is literally just “submit”, so I plan to change it to “get recipe” or something along those lines. I’d also like to learn how to disable the submit button after one use and explore options for form feedback.</p>
                <h3 id="Ex">Example</h3>
                <p><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/">Pinterest </a>shows good form design because the first input field has a colored border on it to draw your attention to it. Additionally, there are very few objects on the screen and the password section has a 'view password' button rather than a double confirmation field.</p>
