                <h3>Initial Thoughts</h3>
                <p>This is a response to this <a href="
                    https://archive.nytimes.com/learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/27/10-intriguing-photographs-to-teach-close-reading-and-visual-thinking-skills/
                    ">article.</a></p>
                <p>I found this article to be a bit humorous, since my attention span is extremely short and I tend to skim (to an extreme level) when it comes to reading.
                </p>
                <h3>User Experience</h3>
                <p>On that same note, I found myself following along with the exercises listed in the article (‘what’s going on in this picture?’ etc.) so I would say this was definitely an effective read. Thinking through these questions is really important because oftentimes, I’ll just throw relevant images into my work.</p>
                <p>But, because I personally know the relationship between the image and my topic (and am biased because I know what’s going on), I don’t really stop to think about how viewers may understand and pick apart the image. 
                </p>
                <p>It seems that this is a great empathy-building exercise.Reading their responses from a user-centered view is really interesting because it gives insight into understanding how people empathize with others (through pictures, in this case). It's important to think about how a user forming a connection with imagery can add to effective storytelling methods.</p>
                <h3>Website Example</h3>
                <p>Please see this<a href="https://www.soon.global/">site!</a></p>
                <p>This website is super simple and so effective. They quickly catch your attention with their website's title, "soon" in motion graphics. As it's the only thing to appear initially, it also creates suspense and makes you feel like you'll see something great "soon". </p>
                <p>Since they're a production company, their cinematic experiences are their greatest asset. The entire background of the website shows off their productions (like it literally plays a nonstop video); so even if you aren't as actively reading the information on the screen, the quality of their work alone is enough to get your attention. The other interactions with the site remain simple to highlight how strong the background of the website is, and the site's hierarchy is very straightforward.

                <h2>Modal Windows</h2>

                <h3>Anatomy</h3>
                <p>This is a response to this <a href=" https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-modals-overlays-dialog-windows-c00c66cddd8c">article.</a></p>
                <p>This article was really informative for me since I’m planning to use an overlay for my Madlib studio project. This is a summary and response to best practices outlined in the article.The anatomy of a modal window is essential for making sure your users don’t feel trapped or overwhelmed.</p>
                <p>They should include a title, an x/cancel button, button labels, small enough size (so it’s not covering too much of the page under it), as well as a shadow behind everything. I also took note that the close buttons should be specific. In my case, this could be something like 1. Retry (get new recipe) 2. Download recipe.</p>
                <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                <p>I don’t regularly use keyboard shortcuts, so I’m happy this article covered common ways for users to exit modal windows using keys. For example, I should code this window so that they can leave by hitting the ‘Esc’ key. Modal Windows also function by trapping the user inside of the window until the dialog is complete, so I should keep this in mind and begin researching how to implement this with JavaScript. </p>
                <h3>Mobile</h3>
                <p>I’m still debating on whether or not to make my Madlib project responsive, because if I were to use a modal window though,  it wouldn’t transfer onto my phone well. With all of these factors considered, I may have the recipe generated onto its own page rather than having it pop up as a modal window. I don’t want to create usability issues for users and planned to give the pop-up a fake paper-like effect, so it’d probably be more effective to style it on a normal page.

                <h2>Form Analysis</h2>
                <time datetime="2024-01-25">Jan 25, 2024</timedate>

                <h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
                <p>This is a response to this <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f?gi=e43efd85f22d">article.</a>
                </p>
                <p>I found this article very helpful and easy to follow, especially since I deal with a lot of dental forms for my job, so I definitely feel familiar with overwhelming form design. </p>
                <p>With this, I’ll keep in mind that forms should have minimal inputs and the goal is to have the least amount of objects on the screen possible. This is important for me since I tend to ask a lot of very detailed questions and will certainly need to keep this in check for my MadLib project.</p>
                <h3>Madlib Revisions</h3>
                <p>I’ve received lots of inspiration from this article for my project, specifically with the ‘one column layout’ rule (since my comp currently has 2 columns), and the efficiency of having a timeline that shows user’s progress in filling out the form. Since my madlib project might need multiple screens of input, I plan to use this technique. </p>
                <h3 id="labels">Labels</h3>
                <p>It’s good practice to keep labels close to the input fields. My Madlib comp currently has tags inside of the input fields, which after reading this article, I plan to change since there are some usability concerns with it (ex: not being able to see the label once you start typing).</p>
                <p>On this note, I would also like to allow users to use the tab button to improve usability. My current submit button is literally just “submit”, so I plan to change it to “get recipe” or something along those lines. I’d also like to learn how to disable the submit button after one use and explore options for form feedback.</p>
                <h3 id="Ex">Example</h3>
                <p><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/">Pinterest </a>shows good form design because the first input field has a colored border on it to draw your attention to it. Additionally, there are very few objects on the screen and the password section has a 'view password' button rather than a double confirmation field.</p>
