            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>I’m choosing to update my gameOn! Project because I feel like I was a little too ambitious with the overall idea of the game so I definitely will not have time to perfect everything by the initial deadline.</p>

            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>I plan to improve aspects of all 3 (functionality, design, and usability), but hope to focus more on functionality. I don’t know if the way I planned out the html and JS is the most optimal and I think my code is way too long/repetitive, especially when the overall concept of my game is relatively simple. I’m not even sure where to start for this, so I hope to figure out the next steps with whoever I decide to ask for help. I also hope to make minor fixes to the CSS since the overlays change size sometimes when clicking through my game, to the point where it’s a bit distracting. Usability wise I do think my game lacks a timeline-like feel, so I want to explore different ways to take the user through a day (ex: a progress/visual timeline, clock, background darkening closer to night, etc.)</p>

            <h2>Feedback</h2>
            <p>I will ask my cousin, who is a developer working at a company called Accenture, to help me out with all of my code. She is very knowledgeable in HTML and JavaScript and does use it for her job, so I think she’d be a great resource. My second expert will be one of the TAs, since they are also quite knowledgeable in how to best structure code.</p>
